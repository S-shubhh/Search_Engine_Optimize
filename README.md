# Travel Query Encryption Application  

## Overview  
This project is a secure travel query application that encrypts user queries on the frontend using RSA encryption, transmits the encrypted data to the backend, and decrypts it on the server. It features a modern, visually appealing interface with animations and robust security for user data.  

## Features  
- 🔒 RSA-based end-to-end encryption for secure data transmission.  
- 🎨 Responsive and aesthetically pleasing UI built with Tailwind CSS.  
- ✨ Animations for enhanced user experience.  
- 🌐 API endpoints to handle encryption and decryption securely.

## Setup Instructions  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
Run the following command in your terminal to clone the project:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-query-encryption.git
cd travel-query-encryption
2. Install Dependencies
Frontend
Navigate to the client folder and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Backend
Navigate to the server folder and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm install
3. Configure RSA Keys
Generate RSA key pair:
bash
Copy code
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
Place the private_key.pem and public_key.pem files in the server/keys directory.
Run the Application
1. Start the Backend Server
Navigate to the server folder and run the backend:

bash
Copy code
cd server
node index.js
2. Start the Frontend
Navigate to the client folder and start the frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
